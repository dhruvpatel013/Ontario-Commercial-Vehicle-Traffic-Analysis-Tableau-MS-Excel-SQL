Project Overview

As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I led a project team consisting of four members with the objective of analyzing commercial vehicle traffic in Ontario. Our project leveraged tools such as Tableau, MS-Excel, and SQL to extract valuable insights from real-world traffic data sourced from the Ontario Government Data Catalogue.

Key Contributions

Data Sourcing and Cleansing: We diligently procured and cleansed a real-world traffic dataset from the Ontario Government Data Catalogue. Our primary focus was on ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the dataset, a critical step in any data analysis project.

Visual Insights: We harnessed the power of Tableau to perform data exploration and create impactful visualizations. Among our key findings was the identification of traffic hotspots during peak hours, with a particular highlight being the observation of 122,104 vehicles on Highway 400 and 401 during a specific timeframe.

Strategic Recommendations: The insights generated from our analysis were not just numbers; they translated into actionable recommendations. We had the privilege of presenting these recommendations to stakeholders from the Ministry of Transportation, Ontario region. These insights aimed at informing strategic decision-making and optimizing traffic management efforts.

This GitHub repository serves as a platform to showcase our work, provide access to project files, code, and visualizations, and foster collaboration with fellow data enthusiasts and potential employers. Please explore the repository to delve deeper into our analysis and insights.
